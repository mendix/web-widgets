Hello maker! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Thank you for opening a pull request to the `web-widgets` repository and helping us make our widgets better. üíô

A small note from the maintainers:

We know that you probably wish to see your cool new feature or fix ASAP, but bringing a new feature to the widget is a small journey. But don't be scared! We just need time to triage, test, and analyze this feature or fix. We may request XML, code, or other changes that may be needed to match our desired look and feel for the new feature. We, as maintainers, strive to make sure that every change made in the code doesn't break existing behavior.

For now, here is what will happen next:

1. Our TotW\* will quickly scan your code and, if all is well, trigger a PR check.
2. We will discuss your new feature or fix within our team.
3. If we decide to add it, we will do code review and testing. As mentioned, we may ask you to make some changes.
4. If all goes well, we will publish this new feature or fix in the next minor or patch release.

IMPORTANT: This repository uses code checks (linters, tests, etc.). Someone from our team will trigger these checks for your PR. In short, we will not proceed with your PR until all checks are green. It's the PR owner's goal to make checks green; maintainers are not going to do it for you.
