Start a new change using the experimental artifact-driven approach.

**Input**: The argument after `/opsx:new` is the change name (kebab-case), OR a description of what the user wants to build.

**Steps**

1. **If no input provided, ask what they want to build**

    Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** (open-ended, no preset options) to ask:

    > "What change do you want to work on? Describe what you want to build or fix."

    From their description, derive a kebab-case name (e.g., "add user authentication" → `add-user-auth`).

    **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT proceed without understanding what the user wants to build.

2. **Determine the workflow schema**

    Use the default schema (omit `--schema`) unless the user explicitly requests a different workflow.

    **Use a different schema only if the user mentions:**
    - A specific schema name → use `--schema <name>`
    - "show workflows" or "what workflows" → run `openspec schemas --json` and let them choose

    **Otherwise**: Omit `--schema` to use the default.

3. **Create the change directory (inside the target package)**

    Specs/changes are PER-PACKAGE. First determine which package this change
    belongs to (ask the user if unclear), then `cd` into it before running openspec.
    NEVER create changes at the monorepo root — a guardrail hook blocks it.

    ```bash
    cd packages/<type>/<name-web> && openspec new change "<name>"
    ```

    Add `--schema <name>` only if the user requested a specific workflow.
    This creates a scaffolded change at `packages/<type>/<name-web>/openspec/changes/<name>/`
    with the selected schema. If the package has no `openspec/` yet, run
    `openspec init` inside the package first.

4. **Show the artifact status**

    ```bash
    openspec status --change "<name>"
    ```

    This shows which artifacts need to be created and which are ready (dependencies satisfied).

5. **Get instructions for the first artifact**
   The first artifact depends on the schema. Check the status output to find the first artifact with status "ready".

    ```bash
    openspec instructions <first-artifact-id> --change "<name>"
    ```

    This outputs the template and context for creating the first artifact.

6. **STOP and wait for user direction**

**Output**

After completing the steps, summarize:

- Change name and location
- Schema/workflow being used and its artifact sequence
- Current status (0/N artifacts complete)
- The template for the first artifact
- Prompt: "Ready to create the first artifact? Run `/opsx:continue` or just describe what this change is about and I'll draft it."

**Guardrails**

- Do NOT create any artifacts yet - just show the instructions
- Do NOT advance beyond showing the first artifact template
- If the name is invalid (not kebab-case), ask for a valid name
- If a change with that name already exists, suggest using `/opsx:continue` instead
- Pass --schema if using a non-default workflow
