#### Breaking changes

- Initial version of Calendar pluggable widget.

- Upgrading from any v1.x to v2.0.0 preview requires re-configuring the widget in Studio Pro. The property panel has been reorganised (e.g. View settings, Custom work-week options) and missing/renamed properties will be reset to their defaults. After installing v2.0.0 open each Calendar instance, review the settings and re-select the desired values.
