## [Unreleased]

## [3.1.1] - 2023-08-16

### Fixed

-   We fixed an issue where it was not possible to select entity attributes in the "line color" expression editor. In versions of the widget before 4.0, after configuring the data source, entity attributes were available in the "line color" expression editor. With this fix, entity attributes are accessible in the expression editor again for both "line color" and "marker color" settings.

## [3.1.0] - 2023-06-06

### Changed

-   We updated page explorer's caption to display datasource.

-   We updated the light and dark icons and tiles for the widget.
