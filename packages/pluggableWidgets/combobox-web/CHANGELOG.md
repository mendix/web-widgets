### Added

-   We added a new property named **Select/Unselect button**, enabling the Combobox widget to display a select/unselect all button on the top of the menu list.

### Fixed

-   Sorting of the search results now follow the sort order set for Selectable objects.

-   We removed the clear button on selected item labels in read-only state.

-   We fixed the positioning of the menu when it is flipped and collides with top of the viewport.

-   We fixed single selection combo box losing focus after selecting an item.
