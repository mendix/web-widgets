## [Unreleased]

### Added

-   We added a new property named **Show footer**, enabling the Combobox widget to display a footer within its menu. When **Show footer** is set to **Yes**, developers can include custom footer content such as text, buttons, links, etc.

### Fixed

-   Sorting of the search results now follow the sort order set for Selectable objects.

-   We removed the clear button on selected item labels in read-only state.

-   We fixed the positioning of the menu when it is flipped and collides with top of the viewport.
