## [3.5.0] - 2023-06-28

### Changed

-   We changed the DOM Structure to from `div` to `ul` - `li` for accessibility purposes.

### Fixed

-   We have addressed an issue that was causing the popup menu to appear behind other elements, such as modal popups. This fix involved modifying the DOM structure by moving the `popupmenu-menu` element to the same level as the trigger button. As a result, custom styling that targets the popup menu may have been affected.
