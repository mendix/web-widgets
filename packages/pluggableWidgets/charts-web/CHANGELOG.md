# Changelog

All notable changes to this widget will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking changes

-   We have removed the "Enable developer mode" property. As of version 5, the playground has become a pluggable widget called "Chart playground." This separation minimizes production code loaded to the client. To enable developer mode, simply drag and drop the playground to the chart you want to edit.

-   We migrated from "Ace" code editor to the "CodeMirror" editor. The new editor comes with better defaults and is compatible with both legacy and new widget runtime.

## [4.2.4] Charts - 2023-11-30

### Fixed

-   We fixed chart's custom configuration not properly merged for arrays.

## [4.2.3] Charts - 2023-11-21

### [3.1.3] AreaChart

#### Fixed

-   We fixed an issue where it was not possible to select entity attributes in the "line color" expression editor. In versions of the widget before 4.0, after configuring the data source, entity attributes were available in the "line color" expression editor. With this fix, entity attributes are accessible in the expression editor again for all "line color", "marker color", and "fill color" settings.

### [3.1.3] BarChart

#### Fixed

-   We fixed an issue where it was not possible to select entity attributes in the "bar color" expression editor. In versions of the widget before 4.0, after configuring the data source, entity attributes were available in the "bar color" expression editor. With this fix, entity attributes are accessible in the expression editor again for "bar color" setting.

### [3.1.3] BubbleChart

#### Fixed

-   We fixed an issue where it was not possible to select entity attributes in the "marker color" expression editor. In versions of the widget before 4.0, after configuring the data source, entity attributes were available in the "marker color" expression editor. With this fix, entity attributes are accessible in the expression editor again for "marker color" settings.

### [3.1.3] ColumnChart

#### Fixed

-   We fixed an issue where it was not possible to select entity attributes in the "column color" expression editor. In versions of the widget before 4.0, after configuring the data source, entity attributes were available in the "column color" expression editor. With this fix, entity attributes are accessible in the expression editor again for "column color" setting.

### [3.1.2] PieChart

#### Fixed

-   We fixed an issue where it was not possible to select entity attributes in the "slice color" expression editor. In versions of the widget before 4.0, after configuring the data source, entity attributes were available in the "slice color" expression editor. With this fix, entity attributes are accessible in the expression editor again for "slice color" setting.

## [4.2.2] Charts - 2023-10-27

### Fixed

-   We fixed an error that was happening when the data source with the aggregation function had an "on click" action. Note: If a data point is aggregated (a single data point on the chart represents multiple entities), only the last entity is passed as a parameter to the associated microflow or nanoflow.

### Breaking changes

-   After updating the widget(s) to this version, a few properties will lose their configured values.
